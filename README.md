## How do I run the script?
**Run the script via the command line with the following syntax**
`python PGenerator.py -l=Password_Length`

#### clarifications;
- `Password_Length` **needs** to be replaced with a valid number that will represent a length of a password
- `-l` ***is necessary*** to include to be able and use the script
- `python` can be replaced with `python3`
